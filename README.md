# Extracting SpaceX Telemetry

Poking at various CV/ML/manual techniques to read numbers from SpaceX's stream.

* [Prelim.ipynb](Prelim.ipynb) - Seeing if OpenCV can read the video or whatever.
* [ExtractDigits.ipynb](ExtractDigits.ipynb) - Figuring out how to match the digits
* [ReadDigits.ipynb](ReadDigits.ipynb) - Parsing a bunch out, plotting them. Kinda slow, processes them (just altitude) at about 1/6th realtime, but who cares.
